# Project Overview

This project is part of the Data Analytics Capstone.
We analyzed customer reviews and delivery data from QuickEats, a rapidly growing food delivery platform.
Recently, the company noticed a sudden spike in low ratings (below 3 stars) and asked the analytics team to investigate the reasons and provide actionable insights.

‚∏ª

üîç Key Findings
 ‚Ä¢ Baghdad is the main source of low reviews, accounting for the largest percentage of ratings below 3.
 ‚Ä¢ Delivery time matters: orders taking longer than 41 minutes received significantly lower ratings, with an average of 70 minutes.
 ‚Ä¢ Basra recorded the highest percentage of wrong orders (42.86% of bad reviews).
 ‚Ä¢ Kirkuk came second for wrong orders (32.50%).
 ‚Ä¢ Erbil topped the list for missing items, accounting for 28.26% of bad reviews.
 ‚Ä¢ There is a clear relationship between Cuisine Type, delivery time, and ratings ‚Üí when delivery takes longer, bad reviews increase.
